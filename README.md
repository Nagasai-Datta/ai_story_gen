# ai_story_gen
This Streamlit-based AI Story Generator leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library with the GPT-2 language model to dynamically create narrative content from user prompts. The application features an intuitive interface where users input a story premise and adjust generation parameters via interactive sliders controlling output length (50-250 tokens) and creativity (temperature: 0.5-1.0). Technical implementations include efficient model loading through Streamlit's @st.cache_resource decorator to cache the GPT-2 instance across sessions, dynamic token length calculation (max_length = prompt_length + specified_length), and robust error handling for invalid inputs or generation failures. The generated story undergoes post-processing to remove the initial prompt and is presented alongside a downloadable .txt file option. Dependencies include Python 3.7+, Streamlit, Transformers, and PyTorch; execution is initiated via streamlit run app.py.
